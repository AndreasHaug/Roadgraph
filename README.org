* Roadgraph
  A simple dummy graph structure of data from the norwegian road
  database(NVDB, Norsk vegdatabank). A preparation/inspiration for a
  future project.

  The code demonstrates how a graph datastructure of some NVDB data
  may be buildt in its simpliest form, nodes and edges connected. In
  addition it demonstrates a breadth first search from a arbitrary
  node. The data used here is the representation of the roads in RÃ¸st
  kommune.
